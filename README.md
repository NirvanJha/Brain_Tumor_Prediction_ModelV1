# Brain_Tumor_Prediction_ModelV1
This project focuses on classifying brain tumors from MRI images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains MRI scans labeled into four tumor categories. The model performs multi-class image classification to assist in medical diagnostics.
